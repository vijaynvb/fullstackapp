### Java Backend Rules
1. Use Java 21 features when appropriate.
2. Always handle null safely — avoid unchecked `NullPointerException`.
3. Use structured logging (`slf4j`) with context data for traceability.
4. Unit tests must achieve >80% code coverage via JUnit and Mockito.

### React Frontend Rules
1. Use functional React components with Hooks; avoid class components.
2. Prefer React Query for data fetching and caching over manual useEffect.
3. Always create PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces for component props.
4. Avoid inline styles — use CSS modules or styled components.
